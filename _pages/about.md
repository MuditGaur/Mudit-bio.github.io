I am a PhD student in statistics at Purdue University. I am being advised by [Professor Vaneet Aggarwal](https://engineering.purdue.edu/IE/people/ptProfile?resource_id=119657) and [Professor Raghu Pasupathy](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/people/faculty/pasupath.html). I did my bachelors in Applied Physics from the Indian Institute of Technology, Dhanbad in 2014. I did my masters in Statistics from Rutgers University in 2017. I worked as a Business Analyst in EXL services in Gurgaon, India from 2014-2016 and as a statistician at Encore Capital Group form 2018 to 2019 in San Diego, USA.


Research Interest
======
I am primarily interested in theoretical aspects of Reinforcement Learning with a particular focus on reinforcement learning algorithms that leverage the use of neural networks. My work involves analyzing RL algorithms and proving convergences for the same. This enables us to bridge the gap between theory and practice for RL algorithms and may lead to new insights. I have also started working on Reinforcement Learning From Human Feedback(RLHF). I am interested in designing new algorithms for an RLHF setup with a particular focus on the alignment problem for Large Language Models(LLM's). I am also interested in proving the convergence for these algorithms

1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "Use this template" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
